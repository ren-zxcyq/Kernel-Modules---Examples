One class of module is the device driver -> functionality for hardware like a serial port.

Each piece of hw is represented by a file in /dev
named a device file which provides the means to communicate with the hw.

i.e., communicates on behalf of a user program.

	->	es1370.o sound card device driver -> connects the /dev/sound
				to the sound card

				this way an mp3 program can connect to the sound card
					via			/dev/sound

- 	MAJOR
	MINOR		NUMBERS		(column separated by a comma)


		debby@deb:~$ ls -l /dev/sda[1-4]
		\brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 1 Jun  9 05:35 /dev/sda1
		brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 2 Jun  9 05:35 /dev/sda2



		here:	MAJOR -> 8
			MINOR -> 1 & 2


	All device files with the same major number are controlled by the same driver.
		here:	2 devices controlled by the same driver


-	2 types of devs

				BLOCK
				CHARACTER

- BLOCK
	devices



	- buffer for requests so they can choose the best order in which to respond

	- storage devices where its faster to read/write sectors close to each other

	- I/O in BLOCKS
		BLOCK devices can only accept input & return output in blocks


- CHARACTER
	devices

	- allowed to use as many or as few bytes as they like.

	- most device in the real world are character devices

		they don't need this type of buffering
		they don't operate with a fixed block size





We can tell if it is		BLOCK/CHARACTER		via:


	b''

	c''


	ls -la /dev
	-----------
	brw-rw----   1 root disk      8,   0 Jun  9 05:35 sda
	brw-rw----   1 root disk      8,   1 Jun  9 05:35 sda1
	brw-rw----   1 root disk      8,   2 Jun  9 05:35 sda2
	brw-rw----   1 root disk      8,   5 Jun  9 05:35 sda5
	crw-rw----+  1 root cdrom    21,   0 Jun  9 05:35 sg0
	crw-rw----   1 root disk     21,   1 Jun  9 05:35 sg1
	drwxrwxrwt   2 root root          40 Jun  9 05:35 shm





	ttyS0
	ttyS1
	ttyS2
	ttyS3			-> SERIAL PORTS






- devices in /dev are created by		mknod

	i.e., Create a new char device "coffe" with major/minor numbers 12 and 2.

	mknod /dev/coffe c 12 2



	We don't have to put the device files in /dev but its a convention



- When a device file is accessed, the kernel uses the MAJOR number of the file
	to determine which driver should be used to handle the access.

	-> KERNEL does not need to know anything about minor number
		DRIVER distinguishes between devices using the MINOR number.


- HW in this context means something a bit more abstract than PCI cards

% ls -l /dev/sda /dev/sdb
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8,  0 Jan  3 09:02 /dev/sda
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 16 Jan  3 09:02 /dev/sdb




	* the above was taken from the book -> at the time of this writing there was only sda on my machine



	- the above tells us that these are block devices
	- block major 8


- SAME MAJOR DIFF MINOR Might also be the same HW device
